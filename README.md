Coding Challenge
========================

The tasks are inspired by the Dungeons and Dragons role playing game.
The dragon-data.json contains data about dragons.
The index.ts file contains description of 5 different tasks.
You can use the index.ts file as a base and extend it with the 
code for solving the tasks. Feel free to add more files as your see fit.
If you prefer to use javascript instead of typescript, then  
create a index.js file based on the index.ts file.

You have 4 hours to solve the tasks described in the index.ts file.
When you are done, then please zip the files and send them back to us.

We will look at
1. how you have solved the tasks
2. how you structure your code
3. which solutions you have chosen to solve the different tasks
4. We will also appreciate to see examples on how you would ensure that your code works
as intended (unit tests)

Be creative and feel free to extend the tasks with additional functions, for example
for sorting, filtering og searching in data.
